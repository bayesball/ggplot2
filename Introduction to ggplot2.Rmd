## Getting Started with ggplot2

First I load in the ggplot2 package.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Here is an example of a scatterplot using the famous Old Faithful Geyser dataset stored in the data frame faithful.

- One indicates that we are using the data frame faithful.
- The geom_point() function indicates we are using a point geometric object.
- By use of the aes(), we indicate that the x variable is eruptions and the y variable is waiting.

```{r}
ggplot(faithful) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting))
```
 
 Experiment with some math:
 
 $$
\frac{W}{L} = \left(\frac{R}{RA}\right)^k
$$
